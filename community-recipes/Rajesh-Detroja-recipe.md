Place Eggs: Gently place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan.

Cover with Water: Add enough cold water to cover the eggs by about an inch or two.

Bring to a Boil: Heat the pot over high heat until the water reaches a full rolling boil.

Cook (Off Heat Method): As soon as the water boils, turn off the heat, cover the pot with a lid, and let the eggs sit in the hot water for the recommended time below.

Ice Bath: Once the time is up, use a slotted spoon to immediately transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Let them cool for at least 10-14 minutes.

Peel: Crack the cooled eggs gently all over and peel them under cool running water, which helps remove the shell more easily.
